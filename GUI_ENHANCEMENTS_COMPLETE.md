- `_update_progress_display()` - Real-time progress updates with ETA

### **New Methods Added**
```python
# Progress tracking integration
_gui_progress_callback()              # Connects backend tracker to GUI
_update_progress_display()            # Updates progress bar and statistics
_show_processing_controls()           # Shows pause/resume buttons
_hide_processing_controls()           # Hides when not processing

# Pause/Resume functionality  
_toggle_pause()                       # Pause/resume processing
_save_processing_state()              # Persist state to disk
_load_processing_state()              # Restore from saved state
_resume_processing()                  # Resume from saved state
_export_current_results()             # Export partial results

# File management
_remove_file()                        # Remove individual files
_update_files_display()               # Visual file confirmation
```
